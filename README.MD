##### TODO:

- [ ] Sync with time of day and remove current animation
- [ ] Add better debug functionality
- [*] Add sunrise and sunset behaviuor to the shader similar to original
- [*] Include calculation of declination angle to offset the cosine wave based on location/time of year
- [ ] Refactor the code because the current stucture is difficult to work with
